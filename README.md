# QC-SCEC-FNAL
This repository contains my work at Fermilab, built off of the work done by @usarica: https://github.com/usarica/FNAL-QCDecodingTests

We compared performance of custom built RCNN models error correction on quantum surface codes as opposed to traditional Keras dense and QKeras dense models. Finally, we translated our traditional Keras models into hls4ml to analyze performance when layers were converted into fixed-point representations.
